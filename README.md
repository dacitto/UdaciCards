# UdaciCards 

UdaciCards is the third project for [Udacityâ€™s React Fundamentals course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

# Project Overview

UdaciCard is a mobile application (Android) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

# Why this project?

## Tests 
The app tested in Realme C25s Android device and Android emulator (android 11).
